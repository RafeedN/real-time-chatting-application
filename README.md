# Real Time Chatting Application

This project is a real-time collaborative web application built using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Web Sockets. The application facilitates asynchronous communication between clients and the server, allowing for real-time collaboration similar to chat rooms.

## Key Features
1. **Asynchronous Communication**: 
  Leveraging web sockets to facilitate real-time data exchange between the server and clients, allowing for seamless collaboration.
2. **Integration of socket.io**: 
  Incorporating the socket.io NPM module to enhance asynchronous communication capabilities, ensuring efficient data exchange over the HTTP protocol.
3. **Design Challenge - Decision-Making**: 
  Addressing the architectural dilemma of data and decision-making responsibilities within the application.

## Project Learning Goals Achieved
1. Web Sockets Implementation
2. HTML and CSS Styling
3. Backend Development
4. File Handling and Data Manipulation
5. NPM Module Integration

## Project Components
### Server:
Built with Node.js: Leveraged native capabilities of Node.js, employing built-in modules for server construction.
Socket.io Module: Integrated the socket.io NPM module to facilitate asynchronous real-time data exchange.

### Client:
Web Browser: Served as the client, receiving a web page from the server containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
